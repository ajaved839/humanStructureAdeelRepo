# Interactive Human Body Anatomy

## Overview

This project is an interactive web-based human body anatomy diagram that allows users to explore different body parts through clickable labels. The application features a skeletal system diagram with interactive elements that display detailed information about various bones and anatomical structures. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides an educational tool for learning about human skeletal anatomy based on the user's Figma design specifications.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Pure Web Technologies**: Built using vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript without any frameworks
- **Single Page Application**: All functionality contained within a single HTML file with supporting assets
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- **Interactive Elements**: Click/hover/touch interactions for anatomy labels

### Component Structure
- **Static HTML Structure**: Base layout with containers for the body diagram and interactive labels
- **CSS-based Styling**: All visual design handled through CSS with gradients and positioning
- **JavaScript Class-based Logic**: `AnatomyDiagram` class manages all interactive functionality

## Key Components

### 1. Body Diagram Display
- **Visual Representation**: SVG-based or image-based human body diagram
- **Responsive Container**: Scales appropriately across device sizes
- **Background Styling**: Gradient background as placeholder for actual anatomy image

### 2. Interactive Label System
- **Positioned Labels**: Absolutely positioned labels over specific body parts
- **Hover/Click States**: Different interaction modes for desktop and mobile
- **Information Display**: Contextual information panels for each body part

### 3. Accessibility Features
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Support for keyboard-based interaction
- **Touch Support**: Mobile-optimized touch events
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML

### 4. Animation System
- **Label Animations**: Smooth transitions and hover effects
- **Loading Animations**: Staggered appearance of labels on page load
- **Responsive Transitions**: Smooth scaling and positioning changes

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: `AnatomyDiagram` class initializes on page load
2. **Event Setup**: Event listeners attached to all interactive labels
3. **User Interaction**: Click/hover/touch events trigger label handlers
4. **Information Display**: Selected body part information shown in info panels
5. **State Management**: Active label tracking and visual state updates

## External Dependencies

### Current Dependencies
- **None**: Project uses only vanilla web technologies
- **Font**: Uses system font (Arial) as fallback
- **Background Image**: Uses user-provided human body diagram from attached assets

### Potential Future Dependencies
- **Anatomy Images**: May require high-quality human body diagram images
- **Icon Libraries**: Could benefit from medical/anatomy icon sets
- **Animation Libraries**: Might incorporate CSS animation libraries for enhanced effects

## Deployment Strategy

### Current Setup
- **Static Files**: Simple HTML/CSS/JS files that can be served from any web server
- **No Build Process**: Direct file serving without compilation or bundling
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Uses standard web APIs for broad support

### Deployment Options
- **Static Hosting**: Can be deployed to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or similar platforms
- **CDN Distribution**: Suitable for content delivery network deployment
- **Local Development**: Can be run directly in browser or with simple HTTP server

### Performance Considerations
- **Lightweight**: Minimal file sizes with no external dependencies
- **Caching**: Static files can be easily cached by browsers
- **Loading Strategy**: Labels animate in progressively to improve perceived performance

### Browser Support
- **Modern Browsers**: Designed for current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- **Mobile Browsers**: Optimized for mobile Safari and Chrome mobile
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works even with JavaScript disabled
